      I'm Ebunoluwa Osujoye — a passionate Frontend Web Developer and Data
      Analyst with a unique blend of creativity and analytical thinking. I love
      turning ideas into responsive, user-friendly websites while also making
      sense of data through clean visualizations and insights. With a background
      in fashion design and a strong love for teaching math, I bring a diverse
      perspective to every project. Whether I’m coding a modern web interface or
      analyzing datasets, I’m driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and
      continuous growth. Currently exploring opportunities where I can build
      impactful digital experiences, collaborate with forward-thinking teams,
      and keep learning.
